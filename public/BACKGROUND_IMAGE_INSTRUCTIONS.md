# Background Image Instructions

To use the process icons background image you provided:

1. Save your background image file as `background-process.png` in the `public/` folder
2. Ensure the image is at least 1920x800px for best desktop experience
3. The component will automatically:
   - Display the image at 40% opacity (so it's subtle)
   - Add a white overlay gradient for text readability
   - Blend with the animated floating orbs

The current setup supports:
- PNG, JPG, WebP formats
- Responsive scaling on mobile
- Proper layering with content above (z-index: 10)

If you need the image resized or optimized, let me know!
